Upholding Philippine Sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea: Strategic Approaches and Countermeasures

Introduction
The territorial dispute between the Philippines and China over the West Philippine Sea (WPS) is a significant issue that impacts Philippine sovereignty and the 
stability of Southeast Asia. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) ruled in favor of the Philippines, invalidating China’s extensive claims under 
the ambiguous "nine-dash line," which lacks any basis under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) (Permanent Court of Arbitration, 2016). 
Despite this ruling, China continues to assert control over the area, fortifying artificial islands and increasing military presence, challenging both Philippine 
rights and regional peace (Constitutional Rights Foundation, 2018). To address this, the Philippines must uphold its claims through a blend of diplomatic, economic, 
and strategic countermeasures, working with ASEAN neighbors to ensure stability and mutual territorial integrity.

Background
The South China Sea is one of the most strategically valuable maritime regions, essential for trade and rich in natural resources. China’s nine-dash line, which 
claims nearly the entire South China Sea, overlaps with the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of several neighboring countries, including the Philippines (RAND Corporation, 
"The Political Geography of the South China Sea Disputes," 2022). In 2016, the PCA’s decision invalidated China’s expansive claims and reinforced the Philippines’ rights 
within its EEZ, particularly in areas like Scarborough Shoal. Despite this clear legal outcome, China’s military buildup and island construction within the region have 
continued, ignoring the PCA ruling and infringing on the rights of other ASEAN nations (Permanent Court of Arbitration, 2016; Constitutional Rights Foundation, 2018).

Legal Justifications for the Philippine Position
The PCA’s 2016 ruling is a critical foundation for the Philippines’ claim in the WPS, as it established that the nine-dash line lacks both historical and legal validity. 
This decision affirms the Philippines’ sovereign rights to resources within its EEZ, covering strategic areas such as Scarborough Shoal and portions of the Spratly 
Islands ("In the Matter of the South China Sea Arbitration," PCA, 2016). By defending this decision, the Philippines not only strengthens its own claims but upholds 
international maritime law, supporting the rights of smaller nations to protect their territories against larger powers (RAND Corporation, 2022).

Strategic and Economic Implications of Assertive Action
Defending its territorial rights enables the Philippines to safeguard vital resources for its fishing industry and potential energy reserves, both essential to
economic security. Yielding to China’s claims could compromise Philippine sovereignty and embolden further encroachments. Standing firm in the WPS reinforces 
national integrity and demonstrates to ASEAN neighbors a commitment to defending regional stability and legal rights (Constitutional Rights Foundation, 2018; RAND, 2022).

Counterarguments and Rebuttals
While some argue that asserting territorial rights could strain economic ties with China, a major trade partner, prioritizing sovereignty over economic reliance is 
essential for long-term stability. Economic dependence on a single partner could jeopardize the Philippines' security interests. By establishing closer trade relations
within ASEAN and pursuing economic partnerships outside the China sphere, the Philippines can reduce economic risks and reinforce support for the international legal 
framework. Collaboration with ASEAN countries provides critical diplomatic and strategic support, balancing relations with China while preserving valuable trade links 
(Permanent Court of Arbitration, 2016).

Proposed Countermeasures
To effectively counter China’s aggressive actions, the Philippines can pursue several strategic countermeasures. First, strengthening diplomatic alliances within ASEAN 
and collaborating with other claimant countries, such as Vietnam and Malaysia, would form a more unified regional stance. This coalition would increase diplomatic pressure 
on China and emphasize the importance of adherence to the PCA ruling and international law.

Economic diversification is another crucial step for reducing dependency on China. Developing trade partnerships with nations within ASEAN and beyond, such as Japan and 
South Korea, can enhance the resilience of the Philippine economy. Encouraging investments from these countries in infrastructure and technology sectors would foster 
economic growth and reduce China’s leverage.

Enhancing defense and surveillance capabilities is also necessary. Expanding the presence of the Philippine Coast Guard and Navy in contested waters, 
along with acquiring advanced surveillance technology from supportive allies, would improve monitoring and response capabilities around key areas, like 
Scarborough Shoal and the Spratly Islands. Working with ASEAN partners to increase maritime awareness and surveillance efforts further strengthens regional security.

International advocacy remains essential. By continuing to advocate for enforcement of the PCA ruling through ASEAN forums and the United Nations, 
the Philippines can garner greater international support for lawful maritime practices. Should further confrontations arise, the Philippines could 
pursue additional cases through international courts, keeping diplomatic pressure on China while reinforcing the legitimacy of its claims (RAND, 2022).

Conclusion
In conclusion, the Philippines must assert its claims in the West Philippine Sea by employing a combination of diplomatic, economic,
and defensive strategies. The 2016 PCA ruling provides a robust legal basis for these claims, and partnerships within ASEAN offer 
essential support. Through these countermeasures, the Philippines can protect its territorial integrity and demonstrate that sovereignty 
and international law are paramount to maintaining stability in one of the world’s most critical maritime regions.
